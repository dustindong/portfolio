    <h1>Scheduled Reports</h1>
    <label>Understanding the Problem</label>
    <h2>Users are looking for a way to automate reports.</h2>
    <p class="pdb-3">Users wanted the ability to send reports on a weekly / biweekly / monthly basis to staff. They were looking for an easier way to do this without manually having to download each report and emailing it. I was brought on to learn more from users and figure out the best solution to automate this task.</p>
    <label>Customer Insights</label>
    <h3>1. Users wanted the ability to send any generated reports.</h3>
    <p>They wanted the ability to send any and all reports that our system offers.</p>
    <h3>2. Users wanted the ability to send reports as frequent or often as needed.</h3>
    <p>Users wanted to be able to send reports as frequent as every week.</p>
    <h3>3. Users wanted to send the reports in both an excel, web based and PDF format.</h3>
    <p>With the flexibility of file format, users wanted to get their staff the exact format that they needed.</p>
